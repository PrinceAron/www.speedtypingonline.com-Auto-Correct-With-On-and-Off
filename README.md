-Auto-Correct-With-On-and-Off
This JavaScript snippet is a typing test cheat script guaranteeing 100% accuracy. It works by intercepting every keystroke: if you press the wrong key, it blocks the input and simulates the correct character instead. The 'Alt' key functions as a toggle switch to instantly turn the auto-correction feature ON or OFF.
